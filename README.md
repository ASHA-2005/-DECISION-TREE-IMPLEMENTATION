## ðŸ“Œ Project Description â€“ Decision Tree Implementation

This project is a part of my internship at *CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, focused on understanding and implementing a **Decision Tree Classifier* using Python. The objective of the task was to apply a supervised machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, visualize the model, and evaluate its performance on a real-world dataset. I developed and executed this project entirely using *Visual Studio Code (VS Code)* on a Windows platform.

Decision Trees are simple yet powerful machine learning models used for both classification and regression problems. Their structure is similar to a flowchart, where internal nodes represent decisions based on feature values, branches represent the outcomes of those decisions, and the leaf nodes represent the final output or class label. The primary benefit of decision trees is their interpretability, which makes them especially useful in educational and business settings.

For this project, I used the *Iris dataset*, which is widely used for introductory machine learning exercises. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, along with their corresponding species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

### Key Steps in the Project:
1. *Importing Libraries*: I used scikit-learn for model creation, matplotlib for visualization, and other helper libraries.
2. *Loading the Dataset*: The Iris dataset was loaded using sklearn.datasets.load_iris().
3. *Data Splitting*: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
4. *Model Training*: A DecisionTreeClassifier was initialized and trained using the training data.
5. *Prediction and Evaluation*: The model was evaluated using accuracy_score to measure its performance.
6. *Visualization*: I used two types of visualizations:
   - *Textual View* using export_text() to represent the logical flow of decisions.
   - *Graphical Tree View* using plot_tree() for a better visual understanding of feature splits and class labels.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*: scikit-learn, matplotlib
- *IDE*: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- *Platform*: Windows 11
- *Dataset*: Iris dataset (from sklearn)

### Why Visual Studio Code?
VS Code was chosen for its rich Python support, ease of debugging, built-in terminal, and useful extensions like Python auto-complete and code linting. It allowed me to smoothly code, install packages, run Python scripts, and visualize output all in one place.

### Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with a key machine learning algorithm, improved my Python programming skills, and strengthened my understanding of data visualization. I also learned how to work through practical issues such as package installation errors and environment setup, which are common in real-world development.

This project also taught me how to interpret and explain model outputs clearly. The decision tree visualization helped me understand how different features contribute to predictions. This interpretability is a major reason decision trees are often used in business decision-making and model explainability tools.

### Conclusion:
The Decision Tree Implementation project was a valuable part of my internship learning experience. It provided an end-to-end view of machine learning development â€” from data loading to model training, evaluation, and visualization. The skills and concepts I learned here will be useful for future machine learning tasks and academic projects.

This GitHub repository contains the complete implementation, including the Python code, instructions to run the project, and a basic project structure for understanding and reuse.
